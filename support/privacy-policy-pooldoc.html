	<p><strong>Effective Date: February 22, 2026</strong></p>

	<p>Pool Doc respects your privacy. This app is designed to work fully offline and does not collect, track, or transmit any personal data.</p>

	<h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
	<p>Pool Doc does not collect any personal information. We do not track users, create user profiles, or gather analytics.</p>

	<h2>2. Local Data Storage</h2>
	<p>All pool logs and water chemistry records you enter in Pool Doc are stored locally on your device only. Your data is not uploaded to any server, cloud service, or third party.</p>

	<h2>3. No Third-Party Sharing</h2>
	<p>Pool Doc does not share any data with third parties because no data is collected or transmitted.</p>

	<h2>4. What Pool Doc Does</h2>
	<p>Pool Doc is simply a logging tool that helps you record and track your pool water test results over time. It:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Stores your test results locally on your device</li>
		<li>Provides basic calculations based on the values you enter</li>
		<li>Displays historical data you have logged</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Pool Doc does not provide pool maintenance services, water treatment recommendations, or professional advice. The app is not a substitute for proper pool care.</p>

	<h2>5. Accuracy of Entered Data</h2>
	<p>Pool Doc does not verify, validate, or guarantee the accuracy of any test results you enter. The app relies entirely on the data you provide. If you enter incorrect or incomplete values, any calculations or suggestions based on that data will also be incorrect or incomplete.</p>

	<h2>6. Calculations, Reference & Disclaimer</h2>
	<p>Any calculations or suggestions shown in Pool Doc are provided for reference only. Chemical amounts, ranges, and recommendations may vary depending on pool type, products used, manufacturer instructions, and local conditions.</p>

	<div class="disclaimer-box">
		<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Pool Doc is provided "as-is" for informational and record-keeping purposes only. Pool Doc takes NO responsibility for:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The accuracy or completeness of any calculations or suggestions</li>
			<li>Pool damage, equipment damage, or property damage</li>
			<li>Water quality issues or pool maintenance failures</li>
			<li>Health effects, injuries, or illnesses resulting from pool care decisions</li>
			<li>Any decisions made based on the app's output</li>
		</ul>
		<p>You are solely responsible for following chemical product labels, manufacturer instructions, pool equipment manuals, and professional pool care guidelines. Always consult professional pool service technicians and use proper testing equipment for critical pool care decisions.</p>
	</div>

	<h2>7. Data Control</h2>
	<p>Because all data is stored locally, you fully control your pool logs. Deleting the app will permanently remove all stored data from your device.</p>

	<h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
	<p>Pool Doc does not knowingly collect data from children. Since no data is collected, there is no personal information stored or shared.</p>

	<h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
	<p>If the privacy practices of Pool Doc change in the future, this policy will be updated and made available in the app and app store listing.</p>

	<h2>10. Contact</h2>
	<p>If you have questions about this privacy policy, you can contact us at: <a href="mailto:contact@m-pax.net">contact@m-pax.net</a></p>
